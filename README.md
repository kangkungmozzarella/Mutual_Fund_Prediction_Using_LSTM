# Mutual Fund Prediction Using LSTM

This project focuses on predicting mutual fund prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for time series forecasting.

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to create a predictive model for mutual fund prices using LSTM networks. Mutual funds are often subject to various market influences, making accurate predictions a valuable tool for investors and analysts.

This project was developed as part of my final project for my studies.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:
- `Mutual_Fund_Prediction_Using_LSTM.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.
- `XSSJ.IK.csv`: The dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Usage
- Run the cells in the Google Colab sequentially to preprocess the data, train the LSTM model, and evaluate its performance.
- The dataset used includes historical prices for the mutual fund, which is preprocessed to be used in training the LSTM model.

## Results
The model's performance is evaluated based on the RMSE & MAPE and visualized using various plots showing the predicted vs. actual prices. The LSTM model is able to capture the trends in the mutual fund prices, but there might be room for further improvement.
